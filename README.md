# voidstranger_vita
Game patches to run VoidStranger on PSVita

Patch for Void Stranger 1.1.3 (Steam or Itch)

The requeriment are mostly the same than running YoyoLoader, but data foder is ux0:/data/voidstranger/

After patching rename the file "data.win" to "game.droid". With 7zip put all the game assets inside te assets folder in the apk and rename the apk to game.apk. Delete everything. Place apk and yyl.cfg in data folder. Is posible to tweak loader options with the cfg, but with the example plays nice.

You can use YoyoLoader to optimize the apk, but asset externalization will not work. 

First launch will take... some time. After that the time load time is around ~1min.

Save files from PC are compatible, but not the save settings.vs or settings.vslocal


## Patch changes
- Optimized all surfaces ingame, whose can be performance killing on Vita.

- Reduced some "particle" effects that made fps go below 10fps, and substituded some instanced objects with gpu particles system.

- Changed masive object instantiation and destruction on late game places to divite it across frames or cap it directly.

- Reduced sound and music file sizes (resampling all WAVS to 31000, reencoding all OGGS, encoding the biggers WAV to OGG). If you want to try to reduce even more the files

- Restored "REST SHUTDOWN" behaviour thas was not included in regular release (as an option in menu Settings->Controls->Misc) so restarting the game is not needed at some points. Game takes some time to launch, so... dream without resting.

- Implemented proper "game_end" on loader (yoyoloader), so it prevents save settings corruption. (For settings to save exiting ingame is needed, trhought the menu "Quit Game" entry or holding "Select")

- Changed global variables acces on random scripts (very random)

- Storing csv in ini string for faster launch time

- Gamepad sprite buttons forced to show the SONY ones. Also edited the "OPTIONS" sprite to be more like a Vita "START" button.


## TODO:
- Rework this readme.
- Find bugs.
- Optimize a little bit more the critica parts.
- Improve loading times.
- Add an option to use original game code instead these tweaks (like not using particle systems)
- Clean code and mixed optimization aproaches. Making small changes, patching, launching on Vita and testing can be tedious
- Externalize part of the music as stream.
- Â¿Porting Endless Void mod?

Credits to EzDzzIt for the csv to GM string idea.
To Rinnegatamante for YoyoLoader, I only striped code and added a few thing.
And more to come.
